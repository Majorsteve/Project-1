Website: http://drinksonme.surge.sh/

API:  https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php

Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Approach Taken:
1. Extracting the ingrediants, measurement, and name of the cocktail api

2. Create a searchbar where you can look up different cocktails through their ingrediants

3. Make the cocktail images in to a click event and have a modal box appear showing the recipe

4. Create a button to toggle the modal box off

5. Use grid box to make the containers responsive when changing the screen size

Struggles: 

Extracting data from the api because of how the objects in the array were listed. Fixed through a comboination of Object.keys to find the array and using a forEach and filter method to specifically pick which objects I wanted.

Win:

Figuring out how to use @font-face. By taking an outside source font style and then downloading the file and then converting the file in to the correct css syntax through a website called fontsquirrel.com.
